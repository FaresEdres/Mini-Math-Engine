## Mini Math Engine

This project implements a simple math engine capable of performing basic calculations and comparisons.

### Project Structure

* `src`: Contains the source code for the Mini Math Engine.
* `include`: Contains header files for the Mini Math Engine.
* `test`: Contains the unit tests for the Mini Math Engine using Google Test (gtest).
* `CMakeLists.txt`: Configures the build process using CMake.

### Dependencies

* CMake ([https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/))
* Google Test (gtest) ([https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest))



### Running the Tests

```bash
./my_project
```

This will run the unit tests for the Mini Math Engine.

### Test Plan

The test plan focuses on verifying the functionality of the Mini Math Engine for:

* **Comparison Operations:**
    * Test cases for `==`,  `<`, and `>`  with various input values.
* **Simple Calculations:**
    * Test cases for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with various input values.
    * Test cases for edge cases like division by zero.

**Note:** You'll need to replace the generic test plan details with specific test cases you've implemented using gtest.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project!.



This is a basic structure, you can expand on it by including:

* Screenshots (if applicable)
* Documentation for your Mini Math Engine functions
* More details on your test cases and expected results
* Contribution guidelines

Remember to keep the README informative, concise, and up-to-date.
